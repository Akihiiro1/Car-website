      <div class="detail-content">
        <p>Regular oil changes are crucial for maintaining your engine's health and performance. Engine oil serves multiple critical functions in your vehicle:</p>
        
        <p>Oil is the lifeblood of your engine, providing essential lubrication to reduce friction between moving parts. As oil circulates through your engine, it also helps cool components and carries away harmful debris and contaminants.</p>
        
        <p>Over time, engine oil breaks down and becomes contaminated with particles, reducing its effectiveness. This degradation can lead to increased engine wear and reduced performance if not addressed through regular oil changes.</p>
        
        <p>Modern engines are designed to operate with specific oil types and weights. Using the correct oil specification is crucial for optimal performance and longevity.</p>
